Mr. GAMAGE denyeth any lybertee of pasture 1ο pass by prescripcion or these
words, first for that they are to[o] bare. 2. In that ‘ ex est parte de NETH ’ is
t0[o] generall. 3. Because hyt appereth not that MORGAN ap GRADOK or LEYSON
hys sonne weare lords of NEWCASTELL or had auctoryte to grant lybertee of
pasture in KEVENCRIBOR. 4. Because RICHARD de Ouum, etc„ doth not by
his dede prove himself lord of NEwcASTELL.

The first is to be judged by lawe.

The second is in like sorte to be judged by lawe.

The third is proved by an other dede of the above named MORGAN ap GRADOCK
of thes words ‘Ego MORGAN ap CRADOK dedi famulo meo RoGERo Com, pro
servicio 20 acras terre de dominico meo in feudo NOVI CASTELLI, etc.,' ante-
dated, and by 3 grete nomber of lyke deds as by th’ originali graunt of th'
said fee of NEWCASTELL by J OHN Erle MORTON then Lord of GLAMORGAN and
after King of INGLAND, to the sayd Momm ap ORADOC before date.

The fourth by dyvers grants 10 1110 53100 dede of RICHARDE de CLARE Erle of
GLOCESTER of divers lands in the fee of NEWCASTELL ‘etde 117 acris terre de
dominico mensae 01030 10 Novo CASTELLO ante datum.'

It is also proved in that th’ abbot and his tenants have tyme out of mynd
enjoyed comon of pasture in th' sayd comon of KEVENKRIBOR.

Fynally 1111 15 proved by an inquisition taken anno 3 EDWARD III. whereby
hit was fownd that GILBERT de CLARE Erle of GLOUCESTER did eject th' abbot
of MORGAN owt of the comon of pasture by thes words, ⁶ et de communi
pastura quam cum aliis liberis illius patriae habuerunt in KEVENCRIBOR‚ etc„
liberavit dictis abbati, 010, dictis, etc„ et pasturam de KEVENCRIBOR, tenendum
in seperali.’

Item the said EDWARD MANSELL claymeth common incertam upon KEVEN-
cRYBOR foresaid by vertue of 3 deede thereof made by RICHARD de TURBERVILE
Lorde of NEwcASTELL for a certaine number of cattaile therein expressas owt

of the granges of LANGEWITH and STORMY.
