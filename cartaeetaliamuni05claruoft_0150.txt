Seal, a smell green button. Device, a half-length figure of the B. Virgin
Mary With the child, very rudely executed.

Fleming of Penllyne and Monktou was a branch of Fleming of Flimston, Richard being probably the
first cadet. Mayioges’ or Mailoc’s Fee, being in the lordship of Llanblethian7 was probably not the half
fee ‘in capella‚' valued at twenty shillings· in 1302. which the Spencer Survey states to have been in
Littiebone‚ or Llystalybont, near Cardiff, although this, which had belonged to William Mailoc, had then
come to Thomas C.i1·11e; but rather the one and a half plough-lancis in Επεὶ Thave, called ‘Mayloke’
There is still a place near Nash called ⁴ Dyffryn Mailwg.’ What is known of the Maelog or Mailoc family
is recorded at length in the Arch. Cambrensis (voi. for 1868, p. 49). It will there be seen how Roget
Mailoc in the thirteenth century, defied the Abbot of 'Fewkesburffi and retained the farm of the benefice
of Llanhlethian ς of which victory probably this· · Mayioges' see' is an abiding evidence.
