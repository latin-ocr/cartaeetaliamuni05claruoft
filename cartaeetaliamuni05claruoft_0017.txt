The family of Wallensis, or le Walsh, whose name speaks their foreign origin, were early settlers at
Llandough by Cowbridge, where they built the castle‚ and lie buried in the church. They also held the
contiguous manor of St. Marychurch.

Adam Waletis tests a Waleran char-ter, in the Francis collection of about 1200 : and Henricus Wallensis
an Umfreville charter of about the same date (75 D. 15). A century later, in 1302, Dominus J ohannes le
Waleys, Knt., tests a Bonville charter (75 B. 22). In the Spenser Survey of 1320, Adam Welsh held one
knight's fee in Llandoch and St. Maryehurch.

According to the local genealogists the descent is as follows :—

1. Adam le Walsh, lord ot Llandough, contemporary with John 18 Wales, 25 Edward Ι. He married
Margaret, daughter and heiress of Thomas Bosnaber, and had—l. Robert3 2, Beatrlce, married Aaron ap
Howell vaehan.

ΙΙ. Robert 18 Walsh, living 20 Edward IL, bore armine 8 bend yules. Married Ann, daughter of Robert
German, and had—l, Adam ; 2, Sybil, married John de St. Marychurch of county Pembroke.

111. Adam le Walsh, lord of Llandoch and St. Marychurch, 1320. By writ dated Oardiff, 28111 October,
1326, Adam 18 Walsh was ordered to raise four hundred foot soldiers for the defenoe of the town and castle
oi Oardiff. (Writs, ii„ 453.)

The next descents are wanting, but there was a Sir Simon Walsh, Knt.‚ lord of Llandough, who married
Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Bawson of Brigan, a Sir Robert Walsh, who witnessed a Kenfig charter
of 20 Richard IL, and another Robert, who lived 4 Henry V. and 1 Henry VI. The Elizabeth of the above
grant was evidently the widow of the latter Robert Walsh. She seems to have had a son or sons then
living, who probably died, as the property passed to the reversionem. How the moiety of West Orchard
came to the Walshes does not appear. The final representatives of the name were two sistere, Gwenllian
and Bettina or Elizabeth.

Gwenllian Walsh of Llandough, part of whose sepulchra] brass remains in that church, and bears the
following ε-ι Hic jacet Wenllian Walsh, quondam uxor Walteri Morton, dom. manerii predicti. Quae
obiit 25 die December, ΑΙ). 1427. Cujus animae propicietur Deus. Amen.' Walter Morton was lord of
Goston and constable of Cardiff Castle 9 Henry V.

Elizabeth Walsh of Llandough, St. Marychurch, and East Orchard, 7 Henry VL, final heiress, married

John de Aune or Van. Their son, Payn Van of Marcross, is said to have sold Llandough and St. Mary-
church to Sir William Thomas, 22 Henry VI.
