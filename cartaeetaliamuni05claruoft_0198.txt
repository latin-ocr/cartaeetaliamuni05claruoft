(1) Brady writes :-⁴ This Thomas Halsey is mentioned in a letter in the Rawlinson MSS. in the
Bodleian, the l7th of January, 1518, and written from Rome by the Bishop of Worcester :—“ Here is the
Bishop of Leighlin [in Ireland] alias named Bishop Thomas, and by his bishopric in 1reland hath nothing.
The Oardinal of York, that was. with his fair promises caused him to take the habit οἱ a bishop, saying
that he would have provided for him of benefices, albeit he never had nothing for him; and likewise the
Gardinal Adi-ian took him in his service, and also with fair promises deceived him, for that the poor bishop
nath nothing save the penitentiaryship‚ ot* the which he may not live as a servant.” [Rawlinson MSS. 484.]
He died about the year 1521, and was buried in the Savoy Church‚ in Lond on.' Episc. Succession, p. 358.
