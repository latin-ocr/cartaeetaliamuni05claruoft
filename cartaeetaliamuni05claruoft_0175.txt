Mr. GAMAGE denyeth any lybertee of pasture to pass by prescripcion or these
words, first for that they are to[o] bare. 2. In that ‘ ex est parte de NETH ' is
to [o] generass. 3. Because hyt appereth not that MORGAN ap GRADOK or LEYSON
hys sonne weare lords of NEWCASTELL or had auctoryte to grant lybertee of

pasture in KEVENCRIBOR. 4. Because RicHARD de CLARE, etc.‚ doth not by

his dede prove 1111115011 lord of NEWCASTELL.

The first is to be judged by lawe.

The second is in like sorte to be judged by lawe.

The third is proved by an other dede of the above named MORGAN ap CRADOCK
of thes words ‘Ego MORGAN ap CRADOK dedi famulo meo ROGERO Com, pro
servicio 20 acras terre de dominico 11100 111 feudo Now CASTELLI, etc.‚’ ante-
dated, and by a grete nomber of lyke deds as by th' originall graunt of th'
said fee of NEwoAsTELL by J OHN Erle MORTON then Lord of GLAMORGAN and
after King of INGLAND, to the sayd MoRGAN ap CRADOC before date.

The fourth by dyvers grants in the same dede 01 RICHARDE de CLARE Erle of
GLOCESTER of divers lands in the fee 01 Ν111νοΑ5ΤΕιῑ, ‘etde 117 acris terre de
dominico mensae 1110ῖο 111 Novo CAs'rELLo ante datum.’

It 15 also proved in that th’ abbot and 1115 tenants have tyme out of mynd
enjoyed 00111011 of pasturc in th' sayd comen 01 KEVENKRIBOR.

Fynally hit is proved by an inquisition taken anno 3 EDWARD ΙΠ. whereby
hit was fownd that GILBERT de CLARE Erle of GLOUCESTER did eject th' abbot
of MORGAN owt of the comen of pasture by thes words, ‘ et de communi
pastura quam cum aliis liberis illius patriae habuerunt in ΚΕνΕΝοΒΙΒοΒ, etc„
liberavit dictis abbati, etc„ dictis, etc„ et pasturam de KEVENCRIBOR, tenendum
in seperali.'

Item the said Enwmm MANSELL claymeth common incertam upon KEvEN-
CRYBOR foresaid by vertue of a deede thereos made by Rmmm) de TURBERVILE

Lorde of NEWCASTELL for a certaine number of cattaile therein expressas owt

of the granges of LANGExvlTH and STORMY.
