Sir John Dawnce aud John Hales were named supervisors 01' the K'mg's lands in 1523, Hales having
been made a Baron of the Exchequer in 1522. He died probably about 1539, so that the date of the above
lies between 1523-1539. [FOSS.]

Richard Siward was Lord of Talavan and Merthyr Mawr, and was imprisoned, and his Castle taken
possession of by Richard,Ea1·l of Gloucester. on a charge of traitorous correspondence with the Earl’s
Welsh opponents. Arruigned before the 'Comitatus ⁷ or ‘Parliamentum’ ot* the Lordship, he refused
to att-end, and *appealed to the Kiug. It was probably the first instance of an attempt to place the
Marches Court distinctly below that of the Sovereign‚ and the attempt was resented by the Earl. (32
Henry 111„ 1248.) Daniel was, it here appears, his son, and Stradliug represented Daniel and iuherited
Merthyr Mawr. The Castle ot* Talavan stood on a steep ridge between Talygarn and Cowbridge,and
some small remains of it may still be seen.

It is not known whether Richard Siward recovered Talavan. or whether Daniel was not a younger son.
