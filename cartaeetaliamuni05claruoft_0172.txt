The pedigree is :—

J enkin Basset=

J acobiis B. Willelmus B.

J enkin in Welsh pedigrees is often used as the Welsh form of John, and the text shews it to be so in
this case. John or Jenkin Basset, of Beaupre‚ who died 1492, was succeeded by his eldest son James‚
whose daughter and heiress Elinor married Sir Rice Mansel, but the male heir was william, second son of
John or Jenkin, and the granter of the above quit-claim. He did not inherit Beaupre, and is therefore
styled generosus instead of armiger; but the messuage in the castle baillie was part of the male fief,
being one of the lodgings provided for the tenants in capite when they were in residence to discharge their
duty of castle guard. Kibour or Kibbwr, now a modern hundred, was the Royal commoto, and a part of it
the chief lord’s demesne land, and contained Cardiff Castle, here called the ⁴ Le Castell Baillie ' in Kibour.
Sir Rees‚ having Beaupre, no doubt desired to acquire the whole οἱ the Basset possessione. Sir Rice left
no children by Elinoi· Basset, but he settled Beaupre on Catherine‚ a daughter by his second wife, on her

marriage with William nasset, the male heir.
The sea] used, the pelican, is that of Carne, and it is curicus, as a similar seal is affixed to the Inq. p.

Mortem of John or Jenkin Basset.
Of the witnesses Lichfeld is not a county name, though Will's de Lichet‘eld occurs 1217 as a monk of

Mai-gam. David and Maurice Wrench occur as witnesses to local charters in the 13th and l4th centuries,
but the name is not otherwise known. John Liddon was probably of Llantwit, where the family lived for

five generations.
