John Turberville, called ‘⁴ G10ff⁰ (or the lame) was about the eighth lord of Tythegstou of his name.
He married Alice‚ daughter of John ap Robert Raglan, whose dower was assigned to her by a jury, leth
February, 1527. Their final heir was their daughter Wenllian, who carried Tythegstou to her husband,
Watkyn Lougher of Sker, whence the present proprietor derives through heirs female.

John Tur-berville of Llanblethian was oldest son of J enkin of the same place, who was a natural son of
Richard‚ father of the grantor of the Charter.

Alice, a sister of John of Llaublessrian, married Thomas ap Griffith Goch.

James Fleming was probably of Monkton. James is a name in the Ross and Aberaman branohes of
Mathew, and not common in any other.
